The Holy Mountain (THM) is a groundbreaking avant-garde pop trio based in Oslo, Norway, blending accordion, synthesizer, drums, and vocals to create hypnotic compositions with dark and mystical qualities.

The band was formed in 2013 by Andreas Angell and myself, after we met at Toneheim community college in Hamar two years prior. THM has released two full-length studio albums (Toad of Light and The Dawns Here Are Quiet), one full electronic album (Ending it All Tonight), one original movie soundtrack (FINITE), an EP (The Holy Mountain), and three original music videos (They Live, Hank Mardukas and So I Shop Up, Adagio).

Crew: <br />
Andreas Angell - Accordion and Songwriter <br />
Aleksander Tidemann - Drums and Synthesizers <br />
Catharina Janner Røed - Vocals

In May 2023, we released our second full-length studio album entitled The Dawns here Are Quiet. The album is inspired by the poetry of Arseny Tarkovsky and nordic cinema and features original artwork by Katinka Hustad, cover design by Bjørn Erik Nyhus, and a unique music video by norwegian filmmaker Marius Rolfsvåg.

In addition to playing drums and synth for the band, I do most of the music tech work and maintain our official website. Links below.
