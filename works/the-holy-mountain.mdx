The Holy Mountain is a groundbreaking trio from Oslo that moves between jazz, electronic synth music, alternative pop, and minimalism. The band's sound combines accordion (Andreas Angell), vocals (Catharina Janner Røed), synth and drums (Aleksander Tidemann) to create unique and conceptual music.

In 2023, we presented our third studio album, "The Dawns Here Are Quiet," a blend of melancholic jazz and pop with lyrics and imagery inspired by Tarkovsky and Nordic cinema. Preceding this, in 2020, we released "Ending it All Tonight," a full-fledged electronic album inspired by synthwave, vaporwave, and the aesthetics of the 80s. Our instrumental debut studio album, "Toad of Light," surfaced in 2018 and was a testament to sci-fi film music and the psychedelic movement in 70s pop culture.

The Holy Mountain has also had a long-term collaboration with filmmaker and director Marius Rolfsvåg, a relationship that has produced one movie soundtrack (FINITE) and two music videos (They Live and So I Shop Up, Adagio) to date.

Already in early 2024, we will be ready with our next album, "They Are Asleep", an upbeat breath of fresh air in our musical career. With this release, our characteristic melancholic sound is mixed with new sources of inspiration, such as Y2K-techno and synth-pop, tightly wrapped together by an overarching theme of sci-fi horror aesthetics.

In addition to playing drums and synth for the band, I do most of the music tech work and maintain our <MyLink href="https://www.theholymountain.net/">Official website</MyLink>.
