!!BILDE!!

Sometime in fall 2022, I found myself talking to a colleague and friend of mine, Dr.Peter Edwards, about modernist composer György Ligeti's upcoming 100-year birthday in 2023. Soon, we discovered that we had a mutual interest in his fantastic composition for 100 mechanical metronomes, called _Poème Symphonique_. As we started to talk about the prospect of setting up the piece, I was amazed to learn how expensive it is to buy 100 mechanical metronomes. Therefore, not surprisingly, our talk ended with us questioning whether it would be possible to digitally model the piece and the synchronization behavior that goes on between the metronomes on stage.

I found this idea so interesting that I spent a lot of time after my conversation with Peter researching algorithms and models that could produce this desired synchronization behavior in the digital realm. Eventually, my curiosity led me to design my own system that can perform a version of Poème Symphonique on demand, using some custom-built MaxMSP (Max) software together with state-of-the-art machine-learning tools for realtime audio processing.

This post shares my whole process of creating a software version of Poème Symphonique. After some backstory, the post details the software development and the final execution of my project, ending with some concluding thoughts.

# Poème Symphonique

György Ligeti is one of the great modernist European composers, born in 1923 in Hungary. Ligeti was especially renowned for his sound-texture explorations and "klangflate" work. In fact, if you've seen Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey, then you have heard some of Ligeti's music before. In the film, the alien monoliths are sonically themed by one of Ligeti's great modernist choir pieces, namely <MyLink hef="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux_Aeterna_(Ligeti)">Lux Aeterna</MyLink>.

Poème Symphonique is an earlier piece by Ligeti, composed in 1962, for 100 mechanical metronomes. On stage, equally sized groups of metronomes are placed on different platforms. For instance, you can have 10 tables, each with 10 metronomes. Before initiation, the metronomes are wound to their maximum capabilities and given a tempo between 50 and 144 BPM. To play the piece, a set of "performers" set in motion the metronome groups at arbitrary times. The piece lasts until the metronomes have run out of mechanical energy.

The unique thing about Poème Symphonique is the synchronization phenomenon that happens between and within the metronome groups. Since they share a common resonator (the table), the metronomes will synchronize to different rhythmical patterns over time. These patterns are always different, always unique, and nearly impossible to predict.

I think the piece says something important about our perception of music. It's also an interesting reminder about the facinating properties of oscillations and rhythm in the natural world.

# Synchronizing Sounds With The Kuramoto Model

Synchronization can be defined as an interaction between independent rhythmical processes. It's a natural process we observe everywhere, from the light pulses of large groups of fireflies to musical ensembles reaching a state of rhythmical unity. Technically speaking, the result of synchronization is a transition to phase equality (θ ≡ θ) for all oscillators in a system at a rate described by how much they are interacting/coupled.

The <MyLink href="https://handwiki.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model">Kuramoto model</MyLink> is a simple and well-known mathematical framework for understanding synchronization
in globally coupled non-linear oscillators, developed by Yoshiki Kuramoto in the
1970s. In simple terms, the model describes how groups of interacting oscillators
synchronize, just like what we experience with Ligeti's metronomes and the firefly
light flashes. I was first introduced to this algorithm online through a great video
by Matt Parker on <MyLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4PO7NbdKXg"> Syncronizing Metronomes in a Spreadsheet</MyLink>.

With the Kuramoto model, we can extract the phase of each oscillator in a system with this simple equation:

Kuramoto-like models have had a significant impact on a variety of scientific fields, including music. A big part of this research has revolved around new complex forms of synthesis, studying how we can derive complex behavior from simple oscillator systems, experimenting with generative synthesis, sonification applications, and even waveshaping.

Rythmn studies is another area of music research where Kuramoto-like models have been utilized (of course). Here, the rhymic synchronization capabilities of the models are at the center. For instance, some of these studies experiment with new self-organizing rhythmical systems, while others seek to develop intelligent systems that can enable better musicking between humans and machines/robots. If you want to learn more about this topic, I made a reference list of relevant papers and articles at the bottom for your reading pleasure.

When designing software to perform Poème Symphonique, the Kuramoto Model seemed like a perfect place for me to start.

# Bringing The Kuramoto Model To Max

When searching for similar implementation of the Kuramoto Model in Max, I came across a candidates I could use for my project.

Most noteably the Kuracillator object by Nolan Lem.

For my thing, I wanted to ...

In the governing equation (see image above), synchronization occurs by the sine of the differences between the phases of all oscillating bodies _N_ in the system. The strength of the interaction between the oscillators is determined by the coupling constant _k_, a parameter that also controls the rate of synchronization.
