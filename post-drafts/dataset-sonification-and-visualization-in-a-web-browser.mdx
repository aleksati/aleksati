Modern web browsers are really astounding pieces of software capable of most computational tasks and creative exploration. Ready-made coding libraries also enable non-web developers to create meaningful audio-visual and interactive art in browser environments. Inspired by these ideas, I ran a workshop in collaboration with the <MyLink href="http://c2ho.no">Creative Computing Hub Oslo (C2HO)</MyLink> in early 2023, focusing on how we can explore Big data using sonification and dynamic visuals in a web browser.

The term Sonification refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Therefore, it's possible to use sonification in addition to visually represented data as a tool to extract valuable and coherent information in realtime.

In this post, I present two approaches you can take to model-based sonification and visualization of datasets in a web browser, using a using the JavaScript <MyLink href="https://p5js.org/">p5</MyLink> coding library.

# Setup and Requirements

Chromium browser. Local and web editor etc.

Using the editor is easier for beginners.

## p5 Setup

how does p5 worj? setup() and draw()..
a interpretation of <MyLink href="https://processing.org">Processing</MyLink> for the Web.

## Example Dataset

Got it from Kaggle.

can use anything you have, as long as the data in multi-dimension and preferably based on time-series

# Graph Approach

Model-based sonification is ...

By interacting with the model environment, you gain important information about the dataset via sound.

Then, the approach.

X and Y (+++ color, size), sound .. also simple LFO for double.

# Object-oriented Approach
