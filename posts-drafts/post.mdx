# Coupled Oscillators - Syncronizing Oscillators/metronomes

In an era marked by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for better online communication tools has never been more critical. Among online interactions, Networked Music Performances (NMPs) stand out as a particularly challenging domain. The chief adversary in achieving seamless NMPs is latency â€“ the time delay often induced by physical distance, hardware/software processing and subpar networks. And latency, in the context of music, has a profound impact on the perception of simultaneity in ensemble playing, disrupting the synchronization that musicians aim to achieve.

A while back, I got interested in synchronization processes that happen "naturally" in the real world, like how big clocks end up in sync over time if in the same room or how analog metronomes sync up if they share the same surface. I was curious about how to represent natural synchronization in the digital audio domain and if these models had any value to time-keeping in networked music contexts.

There is a lot of research that suggests modern and promising strategies to improve timing accuracies in NMPs.
suggest adaptive, gps-related, someting methods
that extend the range of acceptable simultaneity in networked ensembles.
and further democratize NMPs altogether.

Now, there is alot of research out there on strategies to enhance tempo and metronome accuracy in NMPs. For instance like ....
Most of this research has promising results, detailing strategies that are actually able to democratize the world of NMPs by extending the range of acceptable simultaneity in networked ensembles.

But, i didnt find any modeling of this before.

Eventually, my facination led me to develop some code that replicated the Kuramoto Model in MaxMSP, a well-known framework that describes the synchronization of groups of oscillators.
and testing it out.

The Kuramoto Model deals with "coupled oscillators" and My hunch is that it has the potential to enhance the timing accuracy and synchronization in some networked music contexts.
offer some !!!benefits to syncronziation NMPs!!!

In this blog post, I detail my first exploration and experimentation with the Kuramoto model as an adaptive metronome technique for optimizing syncronozation in NMPs.
and whether it can be something maybe. is some potential there.

# The Kuramoto Model: A Powerful Tool for Synchronization

Synchronization is a natural process that can be defined as an interaction between independent rhythmical processes. The result synchronization is a transition to phase equality (theta = theta) for all oscillators in a system at a rate described by how much they are interacting/coupled.

Its models natural
the phenomenon like the way two grand-father clocks will sync up if they are in the same room).

The Kuramoto model is a simple and well-known mathematical model for such natural synchronization, developed by Yoshiki Kuramoto in the 1970s.

f globally coupled non-linear oscillators,

EQUATION HERE

In simple terms, the models describes how a group of oscillators get in into perfect sync, like a musical ensemble reaching a state of rhythmical unity.

In the governing equation, synchronization occurs by the sine of the differences between the phases of all oscillating bodies _N_ in the system. The strength of the interaction between the oscillators is determined by the coupling constant _k_, a parameter that also controls the rate of synchronization.

The Kuramoto Model has been applied in various fields, including the study of interpersonal and social synchronization tendencies and musical sonification.
