After the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been a surge of products that seek to facilitate better musical collaboration over the internet, offering everything from all-in-one hardware solutions, such as <MyLink href="https://www.elk.audio/live">Elk</MyLink> or <MyLink href="https://www.songpark.com/company">Songpark</MyLink>, to new software using tech like WebRTC and WebAssembly. What these products usually offer is better interfaces, slightly lower hardware latencies, modernized web integration, audio/video/network optimization options, and even compatibility with future networks like 5G. However, adequate tech is only one of many parts necessary to conduct successful networked music performances (NMP). Zooming out, NMPs require us to radically change our audio engineering game to accomodate a whole new musical environment.

Through my work as a lecturer and engineer at the University of Oslo, I have organize dozens of NMPs and telematic events since 2019. From my experience, the biggest challenges are often the overlooked and first underrated problems, like chaotic and noisy signal chains, bad communication, ineffective troubleshooting, bad audio quality, and worse time management.

In this post, I focus on some core audio engineering challenges of networked music and provide some easy steps that can drastically improve the audio quality and workflow of your NMP setup. Even though these steps are meant as simple pointers, and are in no way comprehensive nor particularly thorough, I believe they can be helpful to navigate the complicated and often stressful environment of networked audio engineering.

Disclaimer: I will not cover software options or realtime video?? transmission in this post. More on that later.

# NMP Mixer Requirements

The audio mixer is the central nervous system of a concert. NMPs are no different in this regard, but the mixer requirements for NMPs can differ from normal concerts. Because of this, it's important to plan ahead and esnure you have a suitable mixer in time. So before talking about quality, let me map out some basic mixer requirements necessary to conduct a basic dual-audience NMPs, where we expect an audience at both locations.

A good way to start is to consider how many mixes our dual-audience NMP requires. A _mix_ is the digital sum of a collection of instruments where their relative volume (++) is adjusted to fit some context. Concert audio engineers usually create stereo mixes for two main categories; the main speakers (PA mix) and musician monitoring (monitor mixes). For dual-audience NMPs, engineers likely need to handle additional mixes, such as network sends (send mix) and network receives (receive mix).

It can be helpful to think about the send mix as just another monitor mix because it's normal to create separate monitor mixes for every musician on stage. However, we might want to differentiate between monitor and network mixes on one key aspect. While monitor mixes are usually stereo (or mono) it's beneficial to make network mixes as multi-channel as possible. More on this later in the post.

To meet the above mix requirements, each NMP location must have a mixer with at least six stereo output channels and plenty of bus capabilities. On the input side, it's important to reserve enough input channels and keep the received mix in mind from the start. You can quickly run out of channels in these scenarios.

But it's not always that we need to have audience members in both locations. In these cases, the remote and audience-less locations does not need to worry about a seperate PA mix.

# Step 1 - First Connections and Quality Assessment

The first thing you should do when setting up for a NMP is to connect your machines over the network. For this, I recommend to just call the remote engineer on the phone for initial communication. The trick to this process is to go step-by-step, together in synchrony. If you don't move in synchrony, you can fail to troubleshoot simple issues because you do not have similar settings. Some common connection errors at this stage include firewall settings, restricted networks, network ports not forwarded/open, wrong ports and other IP configs, network privacy settings, etc.

Send and receive your network mixes from the mixers to your laptop/machine with a good audio interface (AD/DA).

Start with ping networking tools before moving on to the audio software. Why? Becase

When you have a successfull connection back and forth, setup a talkback channel in each direction.

It will be beneficial if you can bypass the mixer for the talkback .. this

helps to seperate concers and is more stable as its more direct.

# Step 2 - How to Assess the Audio Quality

and test the quality of that connection using a simple middle hz sine-tone. can find it on youtube.
Not through

Use a simple tone-tone! to send back and forth. straight. Not through any mixers or anything.

Straight into the DA.

Adjust software settings and buffer size until the audio quality is good.

Here, also measure the latency if you want.

# Step 3 - Propper Gain Staging

Critically underrated and often underlooked.

When creating your Local and remote mix ..

Loud at the source.. our goal is to minimize the

Communication can be hard. Its more critical that you have the same gain strategy.
Difficult as the network is often stereo. So if you want more piano from the remote side, but not guitar, you have to tell the engineer on the other side to change his send mix to your needs.

Let room mics be room mics.

Always choose the placement carefully. Go back to the source.
Same with mixing.

# Step 4 - Signal Distribution

Dont route in series, only in parralell.
