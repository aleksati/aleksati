The need for better online communication tools has never been more critical, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Among online interactions, Networked Music Performances (NMPs) stand out as a particularly challenging domain, with its significant demands for low latency and seamless audio-video transmission. In music, latency has a profound impact on the perception of simultaneity in ensemble playing, disrupting the synchronization that musicians aim to achieve.

Software tools for communicating online is

more and more nmps

many new technolofies fancy connection ... ut the signal flow and hardware setup

Will not cover software solutions,

Can be confusing because the audio engineering complexity is suddenly much higher.. all the considerations...

noisy signals, bad communication, and bad audio quality, lossy signals

Ive seen it many many times.

I have some tips and step-by-step guide

# Basic Setup Requirements

To play music together over the network.. as set of minimum requirements.

Local mix, Send network mix, Receive network mix, Talkback.

Can be confusing because..

# Step 1 - First Connections

Use phone to com

Connect .. use ping and other networking tools to troubleshoot and find each other.

Use a simple tone-tone! to send back and forth. straight. Not through any mixers or anything.

Straight into the DA.

# Step 2 - Finding the Sweetspot

Adjust software settings and buffer size until the audio quality is good.

Here, also measure the latency if you want.

# Step 3 - Propper Gain Staging

Critically underrated and often underlooked.

When creating your Local and remote mix ..

Loud at the source.. our goal is to minimize the

Difficult as the network is often stereo. So if you want more piano from the remote side, but not guitar, you have to tell the engineer on the other side to change his send mix to your needs.

Let room mics be room mics.

Always choose the placement carefully. Go back to the source.
Same with mixing.

# Step 4 - Signal Distribution

Dont route in series, only in parralell.
