# Improving Networked Music Performances: The Kuramoto Model as an Adaptive Metronome

The world witnessed a dramatic shift in how we communicate and collaborate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to connect online has never been more essential, and this extends to the realm of music. Networked Music Performances (NMP) have gained prominence as musicians strive to make music together across digital divides. However, the nemesis of NMPs is latency, the time delay in data transmission, which are caused by factors like physical distance, suboptimal perpiherals, and audio processing. Latency disrupts the sense of simultaneity in an ensemble, making it challenging for musicians to perform together seamlessly.

In this blog post, I explore an innovative solution to tackle the latency challenge in NMPs by using the Kuramoto Model as an adaptive metronome. This approach has the potential to enhance the timing accuracy and synchronization in networked music performances.

# The Kuramoto Model: A Powerful Tool for Synchronization

Synchronization, or entrainment, is the process by which independent rhythmic processes align or adjust their rhythms due to weak interactions. The Kuramoto model, developed by Yoshiki Kuramoto in the 1970s, is a simple yet powerful mathematical model for synchronizing globally coupled non-linear oscillators.

The model operates on the principle that synchronization occurs when the phases of all oscillators in the system align. The strength of interaction between oscillators is controlled by a parameter called the coupling constant (k). This parameter not only determines the extent of synchronization but also acts as a threshold for the onset of synchrony.

The Kuramoto model has been applied in various fields, including the study of interpersonal and social synchronization tendencies and musical sonification. However, it has seen limited use in the context of enhancing tempo synchronization for musical ensembles.

# Hypothesis: Harnessing the Kuramoto Model for Tempo Synchronization

Our study explores the adaptive mechanisms of the Kuramoto model, specifically how synchronized oscillators can compensate for individual phase variations. We aim to utilize these mechanisms as an adaptive metronome strategy for NMPs. Our hypothesis is that the Kuramoto model can improve tempo synchronization in larger NMP structures. Additionally, by experimenting with different coupling strengths, we seek to understand the relationship between coupling strengths and synchronization accuracy.

# Software Design: Bringing the Kuramoto Model to NMP

To implement the Kuramoto model in the context of NMP, we developed software in the Max8 programming environment. This software created a scalable, user-friendly, and audio-rate version of the Kuramoto model.

In our software, the Kuramoto equation was modified to suit the audio domain. Coupling constants were normalized and scaled to the audio sampling rate. We removed the frequency component to simplify the equation. The software created a phase-driven metronome, where the oscillator phase directly influenced the metronome audio playback. This ensured that metronomes remained isochronic, responding to phase adjustments with precise temporal shifts.

# Experiments: Testing the Adaptive Metronome

We conducted two experiments to test the effectiveness of the Kuramoto model in improving tempo synchronization between NMP clients. Both experiments involved a virtual NMP environment with two clients and one server interconnected in a star-like network topology.

Coupled Experiment: In this experiment, both clients were synchronized to the master using the same instance of the Kuramoto model. We conducted ten iterations, each with a unique coupling constant (K) value.

De-coupled Experiment: In this experiment, clients were synchronized to the master through unique instances of the Kuramoto model. We recorded only one iteration with a maximum coupling strength of K=1, serving as a control experiment.

We collected data on metronome ticks and their temporal relationships between nodes in each iteration. This data was processed and analyzed to measure the average temporal distance and the standard deviation between nodes.

# Results: A Glimpse into Improved Synchronization

Our findings indicate that the Kuramoto model has the potential to improve tempo synchronization in NMPs. In the coupled experiment with K=1, we observed a reduction in the average offset between clients and the server, resulting in a 65.64% reduction in latency between clients and a 13.85% reduction between client 2 and the server.

The impact of coupling strengths on synchronization accuracy was also evident. We noticed that weaker coupling strengths tended to increase the average offset between clients. Surprisingly, the optimal K-value was 0.9, not 1. Lower coupling constants increased the relative distance between all clients and the server, demonstrating the positive effects of higher coupling strengths on synchronization accuracy.

# Discussion: Potential Applications and Considerations

The preliminary results are promising, indicating that the Kuramoto model exhibits adaptive qualities that can reduce the temporal distance between nodes in unstable NMP contexts. This could be beneficial for dynamic audio applications that rely on the model for accuracy, as it offers a simple, low-overhead, and scalable way of managing synchronization for large groups of oscillators.

However, it's important to note that the study did not measure the model's performance in real networking scenarios. Future work should focus on testing the model in actual networked environments, considering the more radical effects of network jitter on audio transmissions.

The study also assumes that musicians are willing to trade some tempo stability for greater synchrony. Whether this trade-off is universally accepted in NMP scenarios remains a topic for further investigation.

# Conclusion: The Promise of Enhanced NMP

In conclusion, this research presents an exciting avenue for improving Networked Music Performances. The Kuramoto model's adaptive metronome capabilities offer the potential to address the latency challenges in NMPs, enhancing timing accuracy and synchronization. While preliminary results are promising, further exploration is required to understand the model's performance in real networked contexts and its impact on different ensemble sizes and coupling strengths.

As technology continues to evolve, leveraging mathematical models like the Kuramoto model may provide musicians with the tools they need to make beautiful music together, even when separated by vast distances.
