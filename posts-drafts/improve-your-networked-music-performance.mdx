BILDE?

After the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been a surge of products that seek to facilitate better musical collaboration over the internet, offering everything from all-in-one hardware solutions, such as <MyLink href="https://www.elk.audio/live">Elk</MyLink> or <MyLink href="https://www.songpark.com/company">Songpark</MyLink>, to new software using tech like WebRTC and WebAssembly. What these products usually offer is better interfaces, slightly lower hardware latencies, modernized web integration, audio/video/network optimization options, and even compatibility with future networks like 5G. However, adequate tech is only one of many parts necessary to conduct successful networked music performances (NMP). Zooming out, NMPs require us to radically change our audio engineering game to accomodate a whole new musical environment.

Through my work as a lecturer and engineer at the University of Oslo, I have organize dozens of NMPs and telematic events since 2019. From my experience, the biggest challenges are often the overlooked and first underrated problems, like chaotic and noisy signal chains, bad communication, ineffective troubleshooting, bad audio quality, and worse time management.

In this post, I focus on some core audio engineering challenges of networked music and provide some easy steps that can drastically improve the workflow and audio quality of your NMP setup. Even though these steps are meant as simple pointers, and are in no way comprehensive nor particularly thorough, I believe they can be helpful to navigate the complicated and often stressful environments of networked audio engineering.

# NMP Mixer Requirements

The audio mixer is the central nervous system of a concert. NMPs are no different in this regard, but the mixer requirements for NMPs can differ from normal concerts. Because of this, it's important to plan ahead and esnure you have a suitable mixer in time. So before talking about quality, let me map out some basic mixer requirements necessary to conduct a basic dual-audience NMPs, where we expect an audience at both locations.

A good way to start is to consider how many mixes our dual-audience NMP requires. A _mix_ is the digital sum of a collection of instruments where their relative volume (++) is adjusted to fit some context. Concert audio engineers usually create stereo mixes for two main categories; the main speakers (PA mix) and musician monitoring (monitor mixes). For dual-audience NMPs, engineers likely need to handle additional mixes, such as network sends (send mix) and network receives (receive mix).

It can be helpful to think about the send mix as just another monitor mix because it's normal to create separate monitor mixes for every musician on stage. However, we might want to differentiate between monitor and network mixes on one key aspect. While monitor mixes are usually stereo (or mono) it's beneficial to make network mixes as multi-channel as possible. More on this later in the post.

To meet the above mix requirements, each NMP location must have a mixer with at least six stereo output channels and plenty of bus capabilities. On the input side, it's important to reserve enough channels and keep the received mix in mind from the start. You can quickly run out of channels in these scenarios.

But it's not always that we need to have audience members in both locations. In these cases, the remote and audience-less locations does not need to worry about a seperate PA mix.

# Step 1 - First Contact

When setting up for a NMP, always make the network connection between your machines first. The trick to this process is to go step-by-step, together in synchrony. For this, I recommend communication over the phone. If you don't move in synchrony, you can fail to troubleshoot simple issues because you do not have similar settings. Some common connection errors at this stage include firewall settings, restricted networks, network ports not forwarded/open, wrong ports and other IP configs, network privacy settings, etc.

Connect your machine to the network and establish a connection with your remote parnters using the ping networking tools. With ping, you will ensure that the machines find each other on the network, meaning that most of the network settings are correct. This step will save you time troubleshooting later on, guaranteed.

DIAGRAM - laptop AD/DA and talkback and mixer network sends.

After some successful pinging, move on to your audio transmission software and connect your network mixes and talkback channel to a decent audio interface (AD/DA). At this stage, be sure to place the talkback and network mixes on separate input channels on the AD/DA in parallel. This way, the talkback channel is not dependent on the mixer and concert system, making it more reliable when troubleshooting. For instance, if there is no sound from the instruments but the talkback still works, you know the issue is most likely in the mixer.

# Step 2 - How to Assess the Audio Quality

Before we do soundchecks. assess quality, check latency, bandwidth and all this kind of stuff.

and test the quality of that connection using a simple middle hz sine-tone. can find it on youtube.
Not through

Use a simple tone-tone! to send back and forth. straight. Not through any mixers or anything.

Straight into the DA.

Adjust software settings and buffer size until the audio quality is good.

Here, also measure the latency if you want.

This are the settings. 
ogs√• si latency tests. 


# Step 3 - Soundchecks And The Importance Of Gain staging

Critically underrated and often underlooked.

When creating your Local and remote mix ..

Loud at the source.. our goal is to minimize the

Communication can be hard. Its more critical that you have the same gain strategy.
Difficult as the network is often stereo. So if you want more piano from the remote side, but not guitar, you have to tell the engineer on the other side to change his send mix to your needs.

Let room mics be room mics.

Always choose the placement carefully. Go back to the source.
Same with mixing.

# Step 4 - Signal Distribution

Dont route in series, only in parralell.
