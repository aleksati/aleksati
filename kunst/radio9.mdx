Radio 9 is a krautrock electronic pop trio based in Oslo, Norway, created by guitarist and composer Leon Muraglia. Musically, Radio9 transitions from subtle electronic atmospheres to jarring post-punk whiteouts. Also, there are live-visuals. But whether you're cruising down the Autobahn or exploring new musical landscapes, Radio 9 will deliver.

Leon Muraglia - Vocals, guitar and songwriter <br />

I played drums and laptop for Radio 9 between 2014 and 2016. In that time, we made one five-track studio album (Our Future Is X​-​Rays) and toured both Norways and the UK, playing such clubs as Blå (Oslo), Østre (Bergen), Windmill (Brixton UK), Komedia (Brighton UK) and many more.
