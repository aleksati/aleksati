summary: "In early 2023, I ran a workshop on creative data sonification and visualization in a web browser. Here are two ways to explore a dataset more creatively using sound and visual, thanks to the p5 JavaScript library."

The term Sonification refers to the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. In early 2023, I held a day-long workshop on how to use sonification and dynamic images to display valuable and coherent multi-dimensional data in a web browser, in collaboration with the <MyLink href="https://processing.org">Creative Computing Hub Oslo (C2HO)</MyLink> at the University of Oslo.

The workshop intended to explore these concepts creatively, using the <MyLink href="https://p5js.org/">p5js</MyLink> creative coding library (a JavaScript interpretation of <MyLink href="https://processing.org">Processing</MyLink> for the Web) and an example dataset from Kaggle as our points of departure.

In this post, I present two detailed approaches for model-based dataset sonification and visualization in a web browser using p5js.
