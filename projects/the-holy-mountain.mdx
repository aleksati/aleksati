The Holy Mountain (THM) is a avant-garde pop trio based in Oslo, Norway that combines accordion, synthesizer, drums, and vocals to create hypnotic compositions with a dark, almost mystical quality. The band was formed in 2013 by Andreas Angell and myself, after we met at Toneheim community college in Hamar. To date (2023), THM has released two full-length studio albums, one full electronic album, one original movie soundtrack, an EP, and three original music videos.

Line-up: <br />
Andreas Angell - Accordion and Songwriter <br />
Aleksander Tidemann - Drums and Synthesizers <br />
Catharina Janner Røed - Vocals

In addition to playing drums and synth for the band, I do most of the music tech work and maintain (+ created) our official website: <MyLink href="https://theholymountain.net">theholymountain.net</MyLink>

In May 2023, we released our second full-length studio album entitled **The Dawns here Are Quiet**. The album is inspired by the poetry of Arseny Tarkovsky and nordic cinema and features original artwork by Katinka Hustad, cover design by Bjørn Erik Nyhus, and a unique music video by norwegian filmmaker Marius Rolfsvåg.
