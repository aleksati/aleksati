While researching master thesis topics at the University of Oslo in 2020, I came in contact with <MyLink href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/mirage/index.html">The MIRAGE Research Project</MyLink>. Through cutting-edge music information retrieval (MIR) and machine learning, MIRAGE aims to build a comprehensive AI-based system for advanced music analysis to improve how computers listen and understand music.

For my thesis, I developed a small software toolkit for MIRAGE (which remained nameless) that was designed to explore the rich performance patterns of Norwegian folk music. More specifically, the toolkit consists of two MaxMSP applications (prototypes), with three modules, that use research-informed and multi-dimensional approaches to visualize and analyze the complex rhythmical structuring in Hardanger fiddle music.

This post takes a quick look at some of the most unique features of my Hardanger fiddle software toolkit. Link to a my full thesis below.

# How To Use It

The toolkit is designed to be used by both musicians and researchers. Therefore, both prototypes have a wide variety of interactive, visual and analytical features that enable users to build and organize datasets and visually explore the unique rhythmic characteristics of the music.

To interact with the modules, the user first imports designated track data into the first prototype. The track data must be specific annotation data (.txt), provided by MIRAGE, that include precise metrics and note positions of a performance. If you want to try the software, you can find some example data to get you started in the GitHub repo of the project.

With the track data imported, users can now navigate the software features and export/import data to the second prototype. For a brief and insightful overview of the basic usage of the software toolkit, its best check out the video demo below.
