!!EVERYTHING IN CONTEXT OF THE LIGETI PIECE!!

Title: something like..
"Using the Kuramoto model as an Adaptive metronome Technique for Musical Synchronization"

Egentlig bare, building the kuramoto model for maxmsp running some tests to see if it might be something to investigate..

all i am doing is really testing the model. also providing some very weak indication that its feasible to test coupled oscillators in networked music settings.

# Coupled Oscillators - Syncronizing Oscillators/metronomes

The need for better online communication tools has never been more critical, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Among online interactions, Networked Music Performances (NMPs) stand out as a particularly challenging domain, with its significant demands for low latency and seamless audio-video transmission. In music, latency has a profound impact on the perception of simultaneity in ensemble playing, disrupting the synchronization that musicians aim to achieve.

a college mentioned in was 100 years since ligeti aniversary. our favotire pice is poem symponique.

Ligeti would have been 100 years.

A while ago, I got interested in synchronization processes that happen "naturally" in the real world, like the way grandfather clocks sometimes end up in sync if they share the same room or how analog metronomes sync if they share the same surface.

happens in the animal kingdom with fireflies flashes in sync.

I was curious about how to represent natural synchronization in the digital audio domain and if these models had any merit in networked music contexts.

in particular, could these self-organizing sync systems be used for adaptive metronome techniques for NMPs.

In the post, I cover ......

My curiosity led me to code up a well-known framework that describes the natural synchronization of groups of oscillators, called the Kuramoto Model, and do some tests to see whether it could improve metronome synchronization in larger networked music contexts (with more than two people).

In this blog post, I detail my first exploration and experimentation with the Kuramoto model as an adaptive metronome technique for NMPs. The post covers important aspects of software development, my preliminary tests of the model on synchronization in NMPs, and some final thoughts on the process.

# The Kuramoto Model and Music

# The Kuramoto Model: A Powerful Tool for Synchronization

suggest adaptive, gps-related, someting methods
that extend the range of acceptable simultaneity in networked ensembles.
and further democratize NMPs altogether.

Synchronization is a natural process that can be defined as an interaction between independent rhythmical processes. The result of synchronization is a transition to phase equality (θ ≡ θ) for all oscillators in a system at a rate described by how much they are interacting/coupled.

The Kuramoto model is a simple and well-known mathematical framework for understanding synchronization in globally coupled non-linear oscillators, developed by Yoshiki Kuramoto in the 1970s.

In a group, each oscillator's phase is given by the following equation:

EQUATION HERE

Coupled Oscillators networks are dynamical systems that describe how ensembles of interacting elements are able to self-organize and synchronize over time. (direkte avskrift)

In simple terms, the models describe how groups of oscillators get into sync, like a musical ensemble reaching a state of rhythmical unity.

In the governing equation, synchronization occurs by the sine of the differences between the phases of all oscillating bodies _N_ in the system. The strength of the interaction between the oscillators is determined by the coupling constant _k_, a parameter that also controls the rate of synchronization.

also, the frequency distr.

each oscillator
is considered to have its own intrinsic natural frequency , and each is coupled equally to all other oscillators.

The Kuramoto Model has been applied in various fields of research to solve a whole variety of problems, such as the study interpersonal and social synchronization tendencies, as well as in musical sonification.

Also to music!!!

# Bringing the Kuramoto Model to MaxMSP

First talk about metronomes . Ligeti's work!

I take a master metronome and sync to that. Then, I provide a "kuramoto-offsett" to each oscillator/metronome in the system.

blabla

Picture of the max code how it is done with audio. the choices I made.

nøyaktig hva som skjer her.

the looping aspect! feedback system.

We can adda phase offset or "frustration" parameter αo in the phase response function to force oscillators into different phase orientations or to account for a time delay in the model.

In the research, the frequency part is important. However, for me(!),
I take all to be the same frequency. purely as self-organizing based on offsets.
This is because ensembles will likely have a

phase-driven oscillator

# Run througs

metronome approach to testing the model
Test the stability of the sync the object against non-coupled.

To test my implementations ability to sync oscillators
two experiments that kind-of mimick a nmp setting, but internally in the machine.
The ideas is that, if this works fine.

I want to learn more about .. coupling strength impact...
