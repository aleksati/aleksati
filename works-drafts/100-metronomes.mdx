BILDE...

Sometime in fall 2022, I found myself talking to a colleague and friend of mine, Dr.Peter Edwards, about modernist composer György Ligeti's upcoming 100-year birthday in 2023. Soon, we discovered that we had a mutual interest in his fantastic composition for 100 mechanical metronomes, called _Poème Symphonique_. As we started to talk about the prospect of setting up the piece, I was amazed to learn how expensive it is to buy 100 mechanical metronomes. Therefore, not surprisingly, our talk ended with us questioning whether it would be possible to digitally model the piece and the synchronization behavior that goes on between the metronomes on stage.

I found this idea so interesting that I spent a lot of time after my conversation with Peter researching algorithms that model synchronization behavior and couple oscillators in the digital realm. As a result, I was able to recreate my own digital version of Poème Symphonique a few months later, using custom-built MaxMSP software and some state-of-the-art machine-learning tools for real-time audio processing.

This post shares my whole process of creating a software version of Poème Symphonique. After some backstory, the post details the software development and the final execution of my project, ending with some concluding thoughts.
