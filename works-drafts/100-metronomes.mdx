BILDE...

Sometime in fall 2022, I found myself talking to Dr.Peter Edwards, a colleague of mine at UiO, about modernist composer György Ligeti's upcoming 100-year birthday and how interesting it would be to someday set up his famous piece for synchronizing 100 mechanical metronomes, _Poème Symphonique_. As our talk went on, I was amazed to learn that buying 100 mechanical metronomes is really expensive, and we soon started discussing whether it would be possible to digitally model the synchronization phenomenon that occurs between the metronomes in the piece.

This idea was so interesting that I spent a lot of time in 2023 researching algorithms to synchronize and couple oscillators digitally. In the end, I was able to recreate my own digital version of Poème Symphonique using custom software I built in MaxMSP together with state-of-the-art machine-learning tools for real-time low-latency audio processing.

This post shares my process of creating a software version of Poème Symphonique in MaxMSP. After some additional backstory, the post details the software development and the final execution of my project, with a complimentary afterthought.
