The Holy Mountain is a genre-defying trio from Oslo, Norway, that moves between jazz, electronic synth music, alternative pop, and minimalism. The band's sound combines accordion, vocals, synth and drums to create unique and conceptual music.

After a four-track EP/demo in 2015, The Holy Mountain's debut studio album, Toad of Light, surfaced on Shhpuma Clean Feed Records in 2018, featuring accordion, synth and drums. The four-part instrumental release was a testament to dystopian sci-fi visions and cult aesthetics, themes that would follow the band further into the future. Two years later, the duo became a trio and ventured deeper into the void with Ending it All Tonight, a fully-fledged electronic synth album inspired by synthwave, vaporwave, and dystopian 80s aesthetics.

But the band's next studio album would department from the previous, and see the trio explore new musical grounds. The Dawns Here Are Quiet (2023) saw the band return to their original instrumentation, with added vocals, and combine experimental and contemporary jazz with alternative and melancholic pop. This eight-track studio album has inspirational ties to the poetry of Arseny Tarkovsky, Nordic jazz and art cinema.

Already in early 2024, the trio is ready with their next EP, They Are Asleep, an upbeat breath of fresh air in their musical career. With this release, the band's characteristic melancholic sound is mixed with new sources of inspiration, such as techno, sci-fi horror and synth-pop.
