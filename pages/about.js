          Music technology enthusiast, drummer, and software developer from
          Kongsberg, Norway. Curious about all things science and passionate
          about art, exercising, my partner, and our cat.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently work as an engineer for the Musicology Department at the
          University of Oslo (UiO) and lecture two master-level courses on
          Networked Music Performance Technologies. In addition to networked
          interaction, my professional and research interests are mostly in
          audio, video and web programming.
        </p>

          On the artistic side, I play drums, synths, and live electronics with
          several Oslo-based bands and do some sound-art installation work from
          time to time.
