Include how to work it out. sand kg -> liter og volum av monitor -> liter

"To convert sand from kilograms to liters, divide the weight in kg by the density of the sand, which is typically abou 1.5 or 1.6 g/cm3 for dry sand. As a general rule of thumb 1kg of dry sand is approx 0.63-0.67 liters."
"

# Figure out the sand density
Density of dry sand is generally about 1400-1600kg/m3. https://www.ftmmachinery.com/blog/density-of-sand-and-sand-size.html or 1.4 and 1.6 g/cm3 

Should use 1600 (or more) since its processed sand

20kg/1.63 = 12.2 iter

If the mass of the sand bags are 20kg, they are aprox 12.2 liter.

# Area to fill

The stands are 8x8x100cm = 6400m3 = 6.4liters, per stand

# How many bags do I need?

6.4 * 4 = 25.6liter total

25.6 / 12.2 = 2.09

So I just over 2 bags og 20kg sand!
