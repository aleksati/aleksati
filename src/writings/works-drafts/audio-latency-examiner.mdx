Since 2020, I have coordinated several courses on networked music performance technologies as part of the MCT Master programme at UiO. This has gotten me above average interested in audio latency. However, whenever I've run real-time latency measurements of audio systems in class or in the field, I've always missed specialized software capable of administering measurement impulses and collecting large amounts of data all in one. In light of this, I recently designed a small software tool with Max8 called Audio Latency Examiner (ALEX), an easy-to-use standalone app for batch collecting audio latency metrics from any external or internal musical device.

In this post, I document how ALEX works and explain some of its main features and design concepts. At the bottom, find relevant links to download the software and report any issues you might have experienced.

# How It Works and How To Use It

ALEX is easy to use and designed specifically for measuring the audio latency of musical devices, such as analog hardware delays, networked systems, virtual audio drivers, and VSTs, with enough features to enable a precise, scientific, and methodical measurement practices. The software collects latency data by evaluating the arrival time differences between audio impulses (click~) that the software itself administers. One impulse travels through the device you wish to measure, while the other acts as a reference. This method provides the exact same initial conditions to the reference and delayed signal chains, ensuring a trustworthy and accurate measurement.

When using ALEX, first set the correct audio and device settings, enable DSP, and choose the correct Mode. Then, start the audio playback. The audio playback engine plays the audio impulse in a sequence on repeat, at a rate defined by the "playback rate (ms)" parameter. The playback rate number determines the time separating each click sound in the sequence. Finally, monitor the input signals to ensure the audio impulses are clean and stable and start the data collection. When you're happy with the data you've collected, export the data locally via the "export" button.

# Modes 

To accommodate a majority of both software and hardware musical devices, ALEX provides the option to choose between different measurement modes. The Modes are essentially routing schemes, deciding where to send and receive the delayed and reference audio impulses. The device input and output channels, sometimes labeled as toDevice and fromDevice, should always go to and from the measurement object, while the reference channels, sometimes labeled toRef and fromRef, should always be the reference chain.  

<MyImage src="alex-modes.png" alt="Choose between External, Internal or VST measurement routing modes." caption="Choose between External, Internal or VST measurement routing mode." />

Upon choosing a mode, the dedicated audio and channel routing are made visible in the patch area. For instance, in the VST mode, the toDevice signal path goes to and from the plugin set in the "3. VST and Plugin Settings" section, while the reference passes "directly" to the measurement inside the software. It's not possible to edit the patch area, but you can select the out~ and in~ channels needed for the External and Internal modes from the "3. I/O and Device Settings" section. 

Below are more detailed accounts of the intended use of the different measurement modes. It should be said that these modes and uses are just templates and simple guidelines. Feel free to use them in any capacity you like. 

## External Mode 

Use the external device mode to measure the roundtrip latency of any external audio device or musical systems, such as delay pedals, mixers, or any other stuff. To get the best results, the routing of the external mode is designed in a a loopback fashion, sending both reference and device impulses out of the computer (to the target device) and expecting to receive the same signals in return. Therefore, using this mode requires the use an external audio interface with two or more inputs and outputs. 

<MyImage src="audiolatency-diagram-loopback-delay.png" alt="The loopback measurement system designed for measuring external audio devices, with added measurement object inserted into one of the signal chains." caption="" />

Remember to specify the right audio driver from the "Audio Settings" section and set the correct channels where to send/receive the reference and device signals under the "3. I/O Settings and Device Name" section. 

## Internal Mode 

Use the internal device mode to measure the roundtrip latency of any internal audio device, such as virtual audio drivers, analysis software or audio units. The routing of the internal mode is designed similarly to the external mode, but sends only one impulse out of the assigned audio driver to a designated audio device, expecting to receive the same signal in return as input. The reference signal in the internal mode is passed directly within the software, not leaving the Max8 environment.

<MyImage src="alex-internal-mode.png" alt="The loopback measurement system designed for measuring internal audio devices, with added measurement object inserted into one of the signal chains."  caption="" />

When using the internal mode, you need to set your audio driver to a virtual audio driver, allowing to send the signal to another software on your machine. Specify this in driver settings under the "Audio Settings" section. Also, set the correct channels to send/receive the device signals under the "I/O Settings and Device Name" section. 

## VST Mode 

Use the VST mode to measure the latency of any VST plugin installed on your machine. The VST mode sends an impulse to a VST and compares the output to a direct signal (reference) that does not pass through the VST (the reference).  

<MyImage src="alex-vst-mode.png" alt="The loopback measurement system designed for measuring vst plugins, with added measurement object inserted into one of the signal chains." caption="" />

When using the VST mode, you must configure the plugin settings manually via the "Show and Configure Plugin" button under the "VST and Plugin Settings" header. Also, since the data does not store the parameter settings of the VST, remember to add notes about the parameters used in the "Add Data Note" section under the "Record and Export Data" header. 

# Monitor Inputs and Latency 

You can monitor the running latency of your device via the number boxes under the oscillator scopes in the "5. Monitor Inputs and Latency" section. These latency numbers represent the time difference between the incoming reference and delayed audio impulses, both in samples and in miliseconds. However, to get reliable results, it's important to tend to the input level gate threshold parameter. 

## Input Level Gate Threshold

Under the "5. Monitor Input Signals and Latency" section, you will find the "Input Level Gate Threshold" number parameter. When passing through analog hardware or delay plugins, the audio impulses administered by ALEX can sometimes get noisy and distorted. However, when evaluating the time difference between the audio impulses, the software relies on stable and clean clicks to be able to make accurate predictions. 

<MyImage src="alex-thresh-yes-no.png" alt="Before collecting data, be sure to monitor the audio scopes to ensure that the input signals are consitent with the rate of the audio playback." caption="Before collecting data, be sure to monitor the audio scopes to ensure that the input signals are consitent with the rate of the audio playback." />

The "Input Level Gate Threshold" is essentially a noise gate that filters out all input signals with normalized amplitude values less than the value specified in the number box by the user. So, by increasing the "Input Level Gate Threshold" you can achieve better signal-to-noise ratios on the input signals for better data. It's best to tune this parameter in real-time while monitoring the input signal in the scope. Increasing the value too much will result in no input at all. 

Last, it should be said that the reference and delayed impulses are subject to this exact same filtering chain before being evaluated.

# Record and Export Data

The ALEX software collects audio latency metrics and device data into a dictionary (JSON) format. Specifically, the latency metrics are float value numbers collected into separate arrays in the dictionary. You can click the "View Full Data" button to inspect the entire data structure and even make custom changes if needed. 

Here is a complete list of data points collected by ALEX:
* device_name = (string) the name of the musical device whose latency you are measuring.
* mode = (string) measurement routing mode
* data_time = (string) the current time when the data collection process was enabled.
* sampling_rate = (int) the current sampling rate of the chosen audio driver
* vector_size = (int) the current vector size (sometimes called buffer size) of the chosen audio driver.
* signal_vector_size = (int) the current Max signal vector size (sometimes called audio block size).
* latency_samps = (array) a collection of the device latency in samples. 
* latency_samps_avg = (float) the number average of the latency_ms array
* latency_ms = (array) a collection of the device latency in milliseconds. 
* latency_ms_avg = (float) the number average of the latency_ms array
* impulse_playback_rate_ms = (array) a list of the audio impulse playback rate used during the collection process.
* note = (string) the personal comment you can add to the data specifying details about the measurement process or device used.

<MyImage src="alex-data.png" alt="data dictionary" caption="The data collected by ALEX is stored as a dictionary (JSON) file and can be exported." />

The data-gathering procedure can be commenced at any time, given that the DSP and Audio Playback processes are enabled beforehand. After collection, the data can be exported as a JSON format object for easy post-analysis and documentation.
