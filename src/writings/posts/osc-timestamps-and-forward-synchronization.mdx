In early 2024, I led a few workshops on the advanced networking capabilities of <MyLink href="https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/index.html">Open Sound Control</MyLink> (OSC) as part of my networked music course at UiO. OSC provides the perfect framework to explore new and interesting ways to synchronize musical devices and manage latency in networked music scenarios due to its high-resolution data transfer (64-bit compared to 8-bit MIDI) and Timestamp integration. 

In this post, I attempt to distill my workshop experiences into a practical, step-by-step guide for implementing a scalable and bidirectional system for synchronizing musical devices using OSC and a strategy called Forward Synchronization, in Python and Pure Data.

# What is OSC and Forward Synchronization?

OSC is a high-resolution, lightweight, and flexible multi-media encoding designed for sending audio control messages between musical devices in real time, similar to MIDI. The protocol was originally developed by researchers Matt Wright and Adrian Freed at CNMAT, Stanford, in 1997 (Schmeder, Freed, 2008). OSC streams consist of sequences of OSC bundles. Each bundle includes a unique identifier, encapsulated message, and timestamp.

/>

OSC timestamps are essentially <MyLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</MyLink> timestamps; a 64-bit fixed floating point number that tells the time since midnight on January 1st, 1900, down to a fractional part of a second. The first 32 bits specify the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1900, and the last 32 bits specify fractional parts of a second to a precision of about 200 picoseconds. For example, the OSC timestamp 1746381622 corresponds to May 5th, 2025, at 20:00:48 PM.

The Timestamp integration makes OSC a perfect candidate for creating custom schemes for synchronizing musical devices across remote distances. One exciting synchronization strategy is called Forward Synchronization, a method described by Schmeder, Freed & Wessel in their 2010 paper _Best Practices for Open Sound Control_.

Forward synchronization is a technique where a fixed delay is added to timestamps that sync two or more musical devices, scheduling all musical events a short time into the future to mitigate two key problems: transport latency between machines and the jitter that destabilizes network communication. However, it's not as simple as choosing an arbitrary delay. To counteract jitter effectively, the clock‐synchronization error must remain smaller than the average transport jitter, and the forward offset itself must be carefully tuned to current network conditions. In any case, Forward synchronization offers us a dynamic framework for building custom synchronization schemes with OSC.

# Code Setup and Dependencies

This guide below details OSC communication specifically between Python and Pure Data (PD). You can choose to follow in both environemnts, as demonstrated, or simply use the one you are most familiar with.

For the Python development, download and install <MyLink href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python version 3</MyLink>. Then, install the libraries playsound, for audio playcback, and python-osc, for OSC commnication, through pip or via download.

```
pip install playsound==1.2.2
pip install python-osc
```

For PD, install <MyLink href="https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data">Pure Data Vanilla, version 0.54</MyLink>. Then, download the <MyLink href="https://github.com/pd-externals/mrpeach">mrpeach</MyLink> library. We will use mrpeach for OSC communication. I recommend installing the 32-bit version of PD vanilla for mrpeach to work as intended.

Find <MyLink href="https://github.com/aleksati/understanding-osc-timestamps-and-forward-sync-of-musical-devices">the full code repository</MyLink> at my GitHub, complete with full PD patches and both jupyter notebooks and pyscript versions of the Python parts.

# Step 1 - Simple P2P Messaging

To be able to communicate OSC bidirectionally over a local network, or between two machines, we must first define some clients and servers. These will be the basis for the entire tutorial.

<MyImage src="osctime-part1-diagram.jpg" alt="osctime-part1-diagram" />

Creating an OSC server in PD is simple using the mrpeach objects. We use [udpreceive] to receive OSC messages from the network, [unpackOSC] to unpack the OSC bundles and finally [routeOSC] to filter based on unique OSC addresses. It's also possible to use the native PD [netsend] and [netreceive] objects to handle the networking. However, note that these objects might require additional config to be compatible with OSC streams.

<MyImage src="osctime-part1-pd.jpg" alt="osctime-part1-pd" />

Similarly, on the client side, we can use mrpeach's [packOSC] to gather OSC bundles before sending with [udpsend]. In the example image above, notice that the OSC bundles are manually opened and closed using square brackets before entering [packOSC].

Last, specify the network port numbers to use. In my examples, I use port 8001 for sending from PD and receiving in Python, and port 8000 for sending from Python and receiving in PD.

In Python, we start by separating the server and client logic. In "./server.py", create a simple OSC server with the python_osc and dispatcher methods. Dispatchers are individual functions passed to server_osc where we can specify precise logic for particular OSC addresses. This is handy if we want to increase the complexity of our code in the future and listen to more addresses at once. In our simple case, we will only create one dispatcher that listens for "/tick" messages.

```Python
# Step 1 - Simple p2p Messaging server
from pythonosc import dispatcher, osc_server
import threading
import time

# Config
serverIp = '127.0.0.1'
serverPort = 8000

# handler for incoming /tick OSC messages
def pyHandler(address, args):
    print(f'{address} {args}')

    if args == "tick":
        # If a /tick message is recevied, print the message
        print(args)

# OSC server and dispatchers
dispatcher = dispatcher.Dispatcher()
dispatcher.map("/tick*", pyHandler)
server = osc_server.ThreadingOSCUDPServer((serverIp, serverPort), dispatcher)

def startOSCServer():
    print(f"Starting OSC server on {server.server_address[0]}:{server.server_address[1]}")
    server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start thread with OSC server and listen for messages
    t_server = threading.Thread(target=startOSCServer, daemon=True)
    t_server.start()
    print("Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Exiting...")
```

Finally, since our Python server will run concurrently with one or more clients, I recommend starting the server in a unique thread. Threading gives us an elegant and dynamic way to start and stop the continuous OSC network transmission processes. We can implement threading using the Threading library. 

We can build a simple OSC Python client in the same way, only using the udp_client class instead and declaring the port and IP to the remote server. In the client code below, each OSC bundle is manually assembled before being sent, similar to the PD client from before. This gives us more control over the bundle content, as we will explore further in the post.

```Python
# Step 1 - Simple p2p Messaging client
from pythonosc import udp_client
from pythonosc import osc_bundle_builder, osc_message_builder
import time

# Define OSC remote client (Pure Data)
clientIp = '127.0.0.1'
clientPort = 8001
client1 = udp_client.UDPClient(clientIp, clientPort)

# Message sending logic
def sendMsg(client):
    print('Sending 10 messages to the client.')
    for i in range(10):
        # Create bundle with IMMEDIATE timestamp
        bundle = osc_bundle_builder.OscBundleBuilder(
            osc_bundle_builder.IMMEDIATELY)
        # Create and add message
        msg = osc_message_builder.OscMessageBuilder(address="/tick")
        msg.add_arg(f'Hello nr.{i} from Python client!')
        bundle.add_content(msg.build())
        # Send the bundle
        client.send(bundle.build())
        # Wait for the next beat
        time.sleep(0.5)

    print("done sending...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sendMsg(client1)
```

# Step 2 - Networked Metronome

In this example, we will build on the code developed in Step 1 and design a simple system for controlling audio playback in a remote location. This metronome will work by generating a tick sound whenever a "./tick" message is received on the server. You can use any tick sound you want, just make sure to include it in the directories of your PD and Python files.

<MyImage src="osctime-part2-diagram.jpg" alt="osctime-part2-diagram" />

In PD, we can use the [soundfiler] object to create a buffer for our tick audio file, and [tabplay~] to play the audio on demand. Sending a bang to tabplay will play the audio once at normal speed. On the client side, simply add a [metro] object at the top of the chain to send tick messages in a nice and consistent sequence.

<MyImage
  src="osctime-part2-pd.jpg"
  alt="osctime-part2-pd"
  caption="The code encapsulated in yellow is new code from the previous step."
/>

Similarly, we must alter the code in our Python server to play an audio file when "tick" messages are received. First, define the path to the tick audio file in a variable (called "audio") in the config section. Then, replace the print message in the dispatcher function with the playsound function from the playsound library and pass the "audio" path variable as its argument. 

```Python
# Step 2 - Networked Metronome server
from pythonosc import dispatcher, osc_server
from playsound import playsound
import threading
import time

# Config
serverIp = '127.0.0.1'
serverPort = 8000
audio = "./tick.wav" # New path to local audio file

# handler for incoming /tick OSC messages
def pyHandler(address, args):
  print(f'{address} {args}')
  if args == "tick":
    # If a tick message is recevied, play audio
    playsound(audio)

# OSC server
dispatcher = dispatcher.Dispatcher()
dispatcher.map("/tick*", pyHandler)
server = osc_server.ThreadingOSCUDPServer((serverIp, serverPort), dispatcher)

def startOSCServer():
  print(f"Starting OSC server on {server.server_address[0]}:{server.server_address[1]}")
  server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Start thread with OSC server and listen for messages
  t_server = threading.Thread(target=startOSCServer, daemon=True)
  t_server.start()
  print("Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

  try:
    while True:
      time.sleep(1)
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Exiting...")
```

In the Python client, we imitate the PD code by adding metronome logic for consistent and stable ticking. First, add two new config variables, BPM and BEAT_INTERVAL. Changing the value of BPM will alter the speed of the metronome ticking. Next, in the sendMsg function, change the for loop into a while loop and insert a sleep function at the end.

The BEAT_INTERVAL variable is passed as the main argument to the sleep function so the rate of the loop is essentially controlled by the BPM variable. Finally, because we are now dealing with an endless while loop, use similar threading logic as the server to start the clients, allowing better cleanup and keyboard control.

```Python
# Step 2 - Networked Metronome client
from pythonosc import udp_client
from pythonosc import osc_bundle_builder, osc_message_builder
import time
import threading

# Config
BPM = 100
BEAT_INTERVAL = 60 / BPM

# Define OSC remote client (Pure Data)
clientIp = '127.0.0.1'
clientPort = 8001
client1 = udp_client.UDPClient(clientIp, clientPort)

# Message sending logic
def sendMsg(client):
  print('Sending messages to client.')
  while True:
    # Create bundle with IMMEDIATE timestamp
    bundle = osc_bundle_builder.OscBundleBuilder(
      osc_bundle_builder.IMMEDIATELY)
    # Create and add message
    msg = osc_message_builder.OscMessageBuilder(address="/tick")
    msg.add_arg("tick")
    bundle.add_content(msg.build())
		# Send the bundle
    client.send(bundle.build())
    # Wait for the next beat
    time.sleep(BEAT_INTERVAL)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # introduce threading for better cleanup of endless while Loop.
  t_client1 = threading.Thread(target=sendMsg, args=(client1,), daemon=True)
  # Start sending messages to remote client in a thread
  t_client1.start()

  print("Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

  try:
    while True:
      time.sleep(1)
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Exiting...")
```

# Step 3 - Timestamp Controlled Metronome

In this segment, I will begin to demonstrate how we can use and manipulate OSC timestamps to synchronize musical devices across a network. The code for this step is almost identical to step 2 but with added logic to include custom timestamps in our OSC bundles on the client side and to review timestamps on the server side.

<MyImage src="osctime-part3-diagram.jpg" alt="osctime-part3-diagram" />

In PD, the mrpeach library conveniently hides most of the complexity needed to evaluate and create timestamps. However, on the server side, we have to add the objects [pipelist] after [unpackOSC] to delay the incoming message according to its timestamp. On the client side, [packOSC] allows us to create custom timestamps for our bundles through the timestampOffset argument. More on this in step 4.

<MyImage
  src="osctime-part3-pd.jpg"
  alt="osctime-part3-pd"
  caption="The code encapsulated in yellow is new code from the previous step."
/>

In Python, we can use the same server code described in step 2. This is because the python-osc library also conveniently hides most of the complexity needed to evaluate timestamps. The client side is a different story.

To pack a custom timestamp with python-osc, we need to supply the OscBundleBuilder function with a timestamp as an argument. However, getting the timestamps and integrating them into our client send loop was not as straightforward as I thought. At first, I attempted to retrieve the current NTP timestamp at the start of the messaging loop in the sendMsg function, using the Python time function, like so:

```Python
def sendMsg(client):
  print('Sending messages to client.')

  while True:
		# Get current UTC timestamp
    custom_timestamp = time.time()
    # open a OSC bundle add our timestamp to the bundle builder object
    bundle = osc_bundle_builder.OscBundleBuilder(custom_timestamp)
    # Create and add message
    msg = osc_message_builder.OscMessageBuilder(address="/tick")
    msg.add_arg("tick")
    bundle.add_content(msg.build())
    # Send the bundle
    client.send(bundle.build())
    # Wait for the next beat
    time.sleep(BEAT_INTERVAL)
```

Unfortunately, this approach failed. Multiple bundles ended up having the same timestamp, being scheduled to play at exactly the same time. After some debugging, I found that the error was due to the sleep function not receiving a unique timestamp at every loop.

To fix the issue, I designed a better system that creates predictable and unique sequences of timestamps based on the BPM and BEAT_INTERVAL variables. In this design, the current NTP timestamp is only retrieved once before the main while loop starts. Then, the timestamp is incremented manually based on the BEAT_INTERVAL and the current iteration of the loop, resulting in unique timestamps whose values are only separated by the duration of one beat.

```Python
# Step 3 - Timestamp Controlled Metronome client
from pythonosc import udp_client
from pythonosc import osc_bundle_builder, osc_message_builder
import time
import threading

# Config
BPM = 100
BEAT_INTERVAL = 60 / BPM

# Define OSC remote client (Pure Data)
clientIp = '127.0.0.1'
clientPort = 8001
client1 = udp_client.UDPClient(clientIp, clientPort)

# Message sending logic
def sendMsg(client):
  print('Sending messages to client.')
  # using the current time once and increment ticks over every while Loop is a more predicable metronome for creating custom timestamp based on a fixed tempo.
  start_time = time.time()
  beat_number = 0

  while True:
    # Custom timestamp = start time + current while Loop round /tick_numb)
    custom_timestamp = start_time + (beat_number * BEAT_INTERVAL)
    # open a OSC bundle and add our timestamp to the bundle builder object
    bundle = osc_bundle_builder.OscBundleBuilder(custom_timestamp)
    # Create and add message
    msg = osc_message_builder.OscMessageBuilder(address="/tick")
    msg.add_arg("tick")
    bundle.add_content(msg.build())
    # Send the bundle
    client.send(bundle.build())
    # increment the beat number for every loop
    beat_number += 1
    # Wait for the next beat
    time.sleep(BEAT_INTERVAL)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Start sending messages to remote client in a thread
  t_client1 = threading.Thread(target=sendMsg, args=(client1,), daemon=True)
  t_client1.start()
  print("Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

  try:
    while True:
      time.sleep(1)
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Exiting...")
```

# Step 4 - Forward Synchronized Metronome

In this final part, we put the cherry on top by achieving Forward Synchronization. Up to this point, we've only sent control messages in one direction and scheduled playback on the server side. Now, we implement synchronized playback at both ends, on the sending and receiving sides, and offset our timestamps to schedule playback in the future.

This is also where we see the full benefit of how we've structured our codebase. To achieve forward sync, we simply reuse the code from Step 3 and create a second local client. This client sends the exact same OSC bundle, previously sent only to the remote server, to the local server as well.

<MyImage src="osctime-part4-diagram.jpg" alt="osctime-part4-diagram" />

in PD, leave the server setup as is, and add another [udpsend] object on the client side. In this second [udpsend], specify the port of the local server running within the same patch. To customize timestamps, use the timetagoffset argument of [packOSC]. The value provided to timetagoffset specifies how many microseconds to offset the current NTP timestamp. So, for example, a value of 4,000,000 (4e+06) results in a 4-second offset into the future. For more details, refer to the object’s help file.

<MyImage
  src="osctime-part4-pd.jpg"
  alt="osctime-part4-pd"
  caption="The code encapsulated in yellow is new code from the previous step."
/>

In Python, we need to make similar changes to the client code. First, duplicate the client logic in the config section to create another udp_client and connect it to the port of your local Python server. To transmit the same bundle to both locations, copy and paste the send function in the messaging loop and make other necessary changes to the Threading logic to ensure both clients are on the same thread.

Finally, add a new variable in the config section called FORWARD_OFFSET. This will define how many seconds into the future you wish to schedule your playback. Then, add FORWARD_OFFSET to the custom_timestmap variable in the messaging loop of the sendMsg function to offset the timestamp a fixed amount.

```Python
#  Step 4 - Forward Synchronized Metronome client (requires the local server to also be running)
from pythonosc import udp_client
from pythonosc import osc_bundle_builder, osc_message_builder
import time
import threading

# Config
BPM = 100  # Beats per minute
BEAT_INTERVAL = 60 / BPM
FORWARD_OFFSET = 4 # seconds into the future to schedule ticks

# Define two OSC clients
# Remote client (Pure Data)
clientIp = '127.0.0.1'
clientPort = 8001
client1 = udp_client.UDPClient(clientIp, clientPort)

# Local client (Python server)
client2Ip = '127.0.0.1'
client2Port = 8000
client2 = udp_client.UDPClient(client2Ip, client2Port)

# Message sending logic
def sendMsg(clients):
    print(f'Sending messages to client.')
    start_time = time.time()
    beat_number = 0

    while True:
        # NEW custom timestamp = start time + current while Loop round /tick_numb) + forward sync offset
        custom_timestamp = start_time + (beat_number * BEAT_INTERVAL) + FORWARD_OFFSET
        # Create bundle with future timestamp
        bundle = osc_bundle_builder.OscBundleBuilder(custom_timestamp)
        # Create and add message
        msg = osc_message_builder.OscMessageBuilder(address="/tick")
        msg.add_arg("tick")
        bundle.add_content(msg.build())
        # Send the bundle to both clients
        clients[0].send(bundle.build())
        clients[1].send(bundle.build())
        # increment the beat number for every loop
        beat_number += 1
        # Wait for the next beat
        time.sleep(BEAT_INTERVAL)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start sending messages to two identical clients (local and remote), but in individual threads
    t_clients = threading.Thread(target=sendMsg, args=([client1, client2],), daemon=True)
    # start sending
    t_clients.start()
    print("Press Ctrl+C to exit.")

    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Exiting...")
```

That's it. Now we have a scalable and dynamic system for bidirectional Forward Synchronization of musical devices between PD and Python.
