        I am a music technologist from Norway interested in drumming, MSP, audio
        and web programming, networked music and studio production. Personally
        curious about everything science and passionate about films, philosophy,
        exercising, my partner and our cat. This website is part portfolio and
        part blog, a platform where I share my projects and write about
        music/audio tech stuff.

        Currently, I work as an engineer for the Musicology Department at the
        University of Oslo. At UiO, I mostly develop long-term musical
        infrastructure, oversee sound studio facilities, teach music technology
        and provide additional research support.
