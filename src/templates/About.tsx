        My name is Aleksander and I am passionate about music, software and
        science. I live in Oslo where I work as a Senior Engineer for the
        Musicology Department at the University of Oslo, and play drums with
        various artists. This website is part portfolio and part blog, a
        platform where I share my projects and write about music
        technology-related topics, such as networked music, audio and web
        programming, studio production and more.
