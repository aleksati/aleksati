        I am a music technologist from Norway deeply interested in drumming,
        audio programming, networked audio, web development, studio production
        and sound engineering. Personally, I am curious about everything science
        and passionate about films, philosophy, exercising, my partner and our
        cat. This website is part portfolio and part blog, a platform where I
        share some of my projects and write about music tech stuff.

        Currently, I work as an engineer for the Musicology Department at the
        University of Oslo. At UiO, I mostly develop long-term musical
        infrastructure, oversee sound studio facilities, teach music technology
        and provide additional research support.
