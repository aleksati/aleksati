        I am a music technologist passionate about audio, science, philosophy
        and music. This website is part portfolio and part blog, a platform
        where I share my projects and write about MSP, audio and web
        programming, networked music, studio production and more. I live in Oslo
        together with my partner and our cat where I also work as a Senior
        Engineer for the Musicology Department at the University of Oslo.
