        My name is Aleksander and I am passionate about sound, software and
        science. I live in Oslo with my partner and our cat where I drum for
        various artists and work as an engineer+lecturer for the Musicology
        Department at the University of Oslo. This website is part portfolio and
        part blog, a platform where I share my projects and write about music
        technology, audio programming, networked music, and more.
