      <p> I am a music technologist and software developer from Kongsberg, Norway, with many years of experience as a multimedia (audio-video) programmer and web developer. I am overly curious about science and technology, and passionate about music, exercising, my partner and our cat. This website is part portfolio and part blog, a platform where I share details of my diverse projects and write about technical stuff that interests me.

      Currently, I work as a Department Engineer at the University of Oslo. Here, I develop long-term infrastructure strategies in teams, teach two ten-credit master-level courses on advanced audio-visual communication platforms and programming, and part-take in various research-related activities. In my spare time, I love to produce, play drums, and do live electronics for several Oslo-based bands and artists.
