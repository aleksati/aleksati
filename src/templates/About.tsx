        I am a music technologist and software developer from Kongsberg, Norway,
        with many years of experience as a musician, multimedia (audio-video)
        programmer and web developer. I am overly curious about science and
        technology, and passionate about music, art, exercising, my partner and
        our cat. This website is part portfolio and part blog, a platform where
        I share my projects, thoughts and write about music/audio tech stuff.

        Currently, I work as a Department Engineer at the University of Oslo.
        Here, I develop and build long-term infrastructure, oversee sound studio
        facilities, teach two ten-credit master-level courses on advanced
        audio-visual networking and programming, and part-take in various
        research-related activities.
