Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fairly new technique where larger models are used to train and improve the performance of smaller models. In this post, I walk through my recent research project where we examined if KD could be used to enhance audio effects (VSTs) built with neural networks. And the short answer is yes, it can! Also included are VST downloads, audio examples, source code and more."},{"slug":"thesunrightnow-screensaver","title":"The Sun Right Now - Screensaver","date":"2025-08-30","keywords":["astronomy","software","nodejs","react","javascript","realtime","programming"],"type":"project","summary":"The Sun Right Now is my new desktop screensaver that displays colorful 4K images of the sun in a cool slideshow.
