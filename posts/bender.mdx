# And why did 'I' have to take a cab?

You are the last hope of the universe. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. That's not soon enough! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Bender, we're trying our best. **Leela's gonna kill me.** _Interesting._ No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

## Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

1. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!
2. Bender, we're trying our best.
3. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

### That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Shut up and take my money! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

- Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.
- And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
- Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

Actually, that's still true. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Hello Morbo, how's the family? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

Really?! You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! It's toe-tappingly tragic! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. But existing is basically all I do! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? I just told you! You've killed me!

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Soon enough. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Bite my shiny metal ass. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! A true inspiration for the children. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

Large bet on myself in round one. Okay, I like a challenge. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Who are those horrible orange men?

And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Shut up and take my money!

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Kids have names? Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Look, last night was a mistake. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? I'll get my kit! Say it in Russian!

I wish! It's a nickel. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!
