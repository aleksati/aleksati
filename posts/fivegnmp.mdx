5G is the new paradigm of telecommunication and wireless networking. The biggest difference from 4G to 5G is increase in speed (bandwidth) due to new network infrastructures. We imagine remote-controlled surgery, distributed sporting events, and even stable Networked Music Performances (NMP).

At the <MyLink href="https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master">MCT masters programme</MyLink>, UiO, we have been experimenting with NMPs for several years. The biggest challenge with conducting NMPs is the exceptionally high demands for low-latency. In fact, research tells us that the ideal roundtrip latency for synchronous NMPs is between 25-50ms. For perspective:
