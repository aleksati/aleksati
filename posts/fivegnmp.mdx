5G is the new paradigm of telecommunication and wireless networking. The biggest difference from 4G to 5G is increase in speed (bandwidth) due to new network infrastructures. We imagine remote-controlled surgery, distributed sporting events, and even stable Networked Music Performances (NMP).

However, playing music over the network is highly challenging with exceptionally high demands for low-latency communication. In fact, research tells us that the ideal roundtrip latency for synchronous NMPs is between 25-50ms. For perspective, here is 30ms of audio delay from left to right channel:

In late 2021, me and my colleague <MyLink href="https://stefanofasciani.com/">Stefano Faciani</MyLink> got in touch with Telenor Research to explore the
feasibility of conducting NMPs over 5G. In this post, I present our experiments on
commercial and private 5G networks, explaining the technical setup, methods, and
preliminary results.

<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>

We conducted two experiments in two separate locations on two different 5G networks.

<h3 id="5g-networks">5G networks</h3>

The first experiment was carried out at the Musicology Department at UiO on a first-generation commercial 5G network. Telenor pre-configured routers for us to access specific Access-Point-Names (APNs) nearby. This configuration enabled faster packet routing and P2P connectivity.

The second experiment was carried out in Elverum on a private 5G Network-on-Wheels (5GNoW) solution. The 5GNoW relies on a Stand-Alone (SA) core network, systems mostly used for experimental testing of various 5G applications in the field.

For both experiments, we used a pair of Huawei H138-380 CPE Pro 3 5G Routers and sent audio and video back and forth using <MyLink href="https://github.com/MCT-master/NMP-Portable-Kits/wiki">specialized NMP hardware kits</MyLink>.

Software-wise, we used....
