Playing live with <MyLink url="https://theholymountain.net">The Holy Mountain</MyLink> has presented some interesting technical and musical challenges over the years. One of these issues has been to solve how I can play drums and synthesizers simultaneously live since we don't like to use pre-recorded samples in our performances.

In this post, I present my newest setup for playing live with THM, demonstrating how to use Python as an intermediate bridge between your MIDI controller and DAW (Ableton Live) to achieve more flexible and efficient MIDI mapping capabilities.
