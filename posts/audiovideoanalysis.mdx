AudioVideoAnalysis is part of the <MyLink href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/mgt-max/">Musical Gestures Toolbox for MaxMSP</MyLink> (MGT), created by Alexander Refsum Jensenius for the <MyLink href="https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/">RITMO FourMS lab</MyLink> at the University of Oslo in the early 2000s.

In 2019, I was assigned to update and refurbish AudioVideoAnalysis, one of the larger MGT applications.

This post is a quick look at AudioVideoAnalysis v2.0; a standalone application for real-time OpenGL rendering of spectral audio and video content.

<h1 id="how-to-use-it">How To Use It</h1>

AudioVideoAnalysis (AVA) generates motiongrams, videograms (video), and spectrograms (audio) from any connected media source in real-time.

Spectrograms are visual representations of the frequency spectrum of audio signals over time. Similarly, motion- and videograms are visual representations of motion in a video over time. We can call both of these representations _spectral images_.

To read more about motiongrams and how they're made, visit my previous post on the <MyLink href="/posts/videoanalysis">VideoAnalysis</MyLink> software.

For documentation and guides on AudioVideoAnalysis, visit <MyLink href="https://github.com/fourMs/AudioVideoAnalysis/wiki">the official AVA Wiki</MyLink>. You can also get a detailed overview of all software operations from the app's help section.

<h1 id="key-features">Key Features</h1>

AVA sports many advanced audio, video, and display options. You can use multi-channel audio, apply inverted and grayscale colors, dynamically adjust frequency logarithms, apply filters, and more.

Let's take a closer look at some of the interesting features of AudioVideoAnalysis v2.0.

<h2 id="rate-of-play">Rate of Play</h2>

AVA works by printing images across the display window from left to right. By default, it takes 60 seconds for the images to loop back to start. However, there is a way to configure the speed of image printing.

<MyImage

  alt="audiovideoanalysis printing rate"
  caption="Adjust the printing rate to peer deeper into the spectral content."
/>

The printing rate determines how fast the images are printed across the display window. By adjusting the _Rate_ dial while monitoring the _Total Display Time_ in AVA's display settings, users can customize a desired speed that corresponds with the length of their recording.

A nice effect of increasing the printing rate is that it will increase the temporal resolution of the images, enabling you to zoom in on the spectral content. However, the downside of higher printing rates is that it decreases the overall image resolution.

<h2 id="analysis-markers">Analysis Markers and Data Retreival</h2>

Perhaps the most useful feature of AVA is the ability to apply analysis markers and retrieve data from the display window. These features can help users to conduct some basic analysis immediately after recording.

The analysis markers are frequency and time labels on the X and Y-axis of the images. The markers give a necessary frame of reference and are especially useful when resizing the window, adjusting the printing rate, or configuring the logarithmic frequency distribution of the spectrogram.

  alt="videoanalysis analysis markers."
  caption="Analysis markers and grids can assist with orientation and analysis."
/>

Further, it's possible to add a grid structure over the images, called a _Display Grid_. The size and visibility of the display grid can be set through the _Grid Size_ and _View Display Grid_ options in the menubar.

To accommodate the analysis markers and grid function, AVA features clickpoint data retrieval. By clicking on the spectrogram, users can retrieve sound energy/amplitude data at specific frequencies for a more detailed inspection of the spectral audio content.

<MyImage

  alt="audiovideoanalysis clickpoint"
  caption="Retrieve Hz, Amplitude, and Time from anywhere on the spectrogram at clickpoint."

I first learned about clickpoint data retrieval in this paper by Jean-Francois Charles called <MyLink href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/comj.2008.32.3.87">A Tutorial on Spectral Sound Processing Using Max/MSP and Jitter</MyLink>. I used Jean-Francois' algorithms as the basis for my implementation.

<h2 id="image-layering">Image Layering</h2>

To add to the visual and real-time capabilities of AVA, I introduced additional display options for image layering. With image layering, users can view spectral images in different configurations in the display window.

The layering options include the ability to view the images individually (only audio or only video), in a cake-like fashion (one in on top of the other), or layered (one is over the other).

<h2 id="export-options">Export Options</h2>

The images created in the AVA display window can be exported via the menubar export options. The available formats are JPEG, TIFF (lossless), and PNG.

Unfortunately, the image resolution cannot be customized due to several processing constraints. The maximum export image resolution is 1024x720, and it will only decrease based on the printing rate used.

<h1 id="downloads">Downloads</h1>
