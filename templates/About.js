        I currently work as an engineer for the Musicology Department at the
        University of Oslo (UiO) and lecture two master-level courses on
        Networked Music Performance Technologies. In addition to networked
        interaction, my professional and research interests are mostly in audio,
        video and web programming.

        On the artistic side, I have years of experience playing drums, synths,
        and live electronics with multiple Oslo-based acts. However, my most
        recent and exciting interests are creative computing and sound-art
        installation work.
