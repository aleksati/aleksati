      <p>
        Music/sound technologist, drummer, and software developer from Norway.
        Curious about all things science and passionate about art, exercising,
        my partner, and our cat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work as an engineer for the Musicology Department at the
        University of Oslo (UiO) and lecture two master-level courses on
        Networked Music Performance Technologies. In addition to networked
        interaction, my professional and research interests are mostly in audio,
        video, and web programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the artistic side, I have many years of experience playing drums,
        synths, and electronics with several Oslo-based acts. Besides music, I
        spend most of my time on creative software projects and sound-art
        installation work.
