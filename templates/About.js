        I am a music technologist audio developer from Kongsberg, Norway,
        curious about all things science and passionate about art, exercising,
        my partner and our cat. This website is part portfolio and part blog, a
        platform where I share details of my projects and write about other
        creative computing stuff.

        Currently, I work as a Department Engineer for the Musicology Department
        (IMV) at the University of Oslo (UiO). At IMV I also lecture and
        coordinate two courses on Networked Music Performance Technologies
        (MCT4024 and MCT4025) for the MCT masters programme. On the artistic
        side, I play drums and live electronics for several Oslo-based acts and
        have years of experience as an audio programmer and creative software
        developer.
