        I am a drummer, music technologist, and coding enthusiast living in
        Oslo, Norway. Personally curious about all things science and passionate
        about art, exercising, my partner, and our cat. My current work is as a
        Department Engineer for the Musicology Department at the University of
        Oslo (UiO). There I also lecture and coordinate two courses on Networked
        Music Performance Technologies (

        and MCT4025) for the MCT masters programme.

        On the more artistic side, I play drums and live electronics for several
        Oslo-based acts and have years of experience as a session musician,
        improviser, sound designer and music producer. But besides the
        performing arts, my biggest artistic ventures are in creative computing,
        sound-art installation work and software development. I spend most of my
        free time building audio-visual tools, small embedded systems, websites,
        analysis apps, controllers, and more.

        This page is one of my projects, part portfolio and part blog. It's an
        attempt to document and share as much knowledge on music tech-related
        matters as I can, drawing from a broad (and ever-expanding) experience
        in the field. Hope you find it helpful.
