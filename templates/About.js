        Music technology enthusiast, drummer, and software developer from
        Kongsberg, Norway. Curious about all things science and passionate about
        art, exercising, my partner, and our cat.

      <p>
        I currently work as an engineer for the Musicology Department at the
        University of Oslo (UiO) and lecture two master-level courses on
        Networked Music Performance Technologies. In addition to networked
        interaction, my professional and research interests are mostly in audio,
        video and web programming.

        On the artistic side, I play drums, synths, and live electronics with
        several Oslo-based bands and do some sound-art installation work from
        time to time.
