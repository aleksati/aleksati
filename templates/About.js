        I am a drummer and music technologist from Kongsberg, Norway. Curious
        about all things science and passionate about art, exercising, my
        partner and our cat. This site is part portfolio and part blog, a
        platform where I share my music tech projects and write about creative
        computing/software stuff that might interest you.

        Currently, I work as a Department Engineer for the Musicology Department
        (IMV) at the University of Oslo (UiO). At IMV I also lecture and
        coordinate two courses on Networked Music Performance Technologies
        (MCT4024 and MCT4025) for the MCT masters programme. On the more
        artistic side, I play drums and live electronics for several Oslo-based
        acts and have years of experience as a session musician, improviser, and
        music producer.
